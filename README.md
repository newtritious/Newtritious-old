## About The Project

Nutrition app built by Trilogy bootcamp alumni to let a user find their caloric needs (using a calculator) and set a calorie goal. A user can search for specific food nutrition and recipes. Recipes will show ingredients and steps to make a meal, show the nutrition details of the recipe and save the recipe, and log the recipe as a meal. A user can add meals for the day to show the total amount of calories consumed and view any past meals they have logged.
